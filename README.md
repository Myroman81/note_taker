# note_taker
For this challenge we've set out to build a note taking application that facilitates organization and helps to create a database of saved material when the application is used.  As challenging as other projects have been I think I've struggled with this the most.  Trying to combine all the working parts has been very difficult and this is definitely a work in progress.  It seems to be only halfway finished unfortunately.  As a developer's tool we were given HTML and CSS coding and I've added JavaScript and used express.js and node.js.
